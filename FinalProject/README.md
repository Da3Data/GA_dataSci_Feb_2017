# SYD DAT 7 - Visualisation and Regression

##Homework - Due March 13th, 2017


* For the following use the github repository you made for your project. 

* Load some data you have gathered for your project into Python.

* Identify some numeric and categorical features in your data. Write this up in a file called README.md 
    * numeric = ratingsDF.head()
      the 'ratings' column shows values 1 to 5 with 5 being the best.
   
    * categorical data appears in the Movies.dat file under column 'Genres'. 
      Later I might try and split the genres into other columns as it may make more sense when predicting what genre a user will like.
      Other categorical data appears in the Users.dat file under column 'Occupation'. As stated in the notebook 'Homework2_DennisA'        Occupation has a mapping to more descriptive values - in a later stage I will update this column. e.g. Occupation 15 = scientist. 

* Run some summary statistics over the numeric data.
    * describe() get mean, counts etc

* Are there any interesting features of the data that jump out?
    * insight/discovery analysis
    
* Generate some data visualisations that would be useful for you to explore your data set, particularly the numeric data right now.

* If you can find any good candidates for a regression, try some regressors out.
