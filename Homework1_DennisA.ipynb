    "# 1) Summary of Chapter 4 of The Data Science Handbook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science in Journalism\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks like an interesting book I can tell by looking at the contents. I often get lost in the maze while researching data science because there is so many topics which branch off into so many other topics. So its good to read concise stories from practical Data Scientists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting to know the interviewee is a data ambassador for a non-profit organization called DataKind. They have a few chapters throughout the world but not in Sydney. I will do more research to hopefully find a similar group in Sydney. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection can be very pervasive as highlighted in Mikes time spent working with Unilever to attach sensors to tooth brushes while collecting data on brushing behaviour. To me there is a wide range of uses for collecting data and personally I would rather spend my time working on more meaningful projects than improving brushing techniques. However this was early in Mikes career and his exposure to Unilever could have helped him with other jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also important to note that he got the job at Bitly through networking with his colleagues friends. This is something I plan to keep in mind as I transition into a data science role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mike gives good advice on his techniques for understanding data through drawing pictures/diagrams of how things work. This becomes part of business analysis which should be before you even start manipulating any data. He emphasizes on visualizing the data first before delving into the theory. I can also relate to this when I do my own analysis. Drawing pictures allows you to converse with the clients or business owners to show your understanding of how you think things work. Then changes can be made to improve your understanding/assumptions by asking for the clients review. I believe this is a good methodology that can be applied to most projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mike has had an interesting career and good to see he hasnt just worked in traditional tech jobs in banks etc. I can tell he is ambitious and possibly most data scientists are. From other articles I have read it suggests the majority have a PhD. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was previously introduced to similar handbooks a few years ago where CEO & Managers, Researchers & Academics would comment on their experience with Data Analysis. I plan to read the whole book as It will help in my preparation for landing a data science role in the future.\n"

Ability to present to prospective employer as I am interested in music and data science so would like to combine the two as a career.\n",

    "What outcome to achieve | future planning; knowing the number of work orders in the future (based on several variables) will help the auditing team plan their work. They conduct audits on sample sizes so knowing roughly how many work orders will occur will help them plan their time. I will also talk to other senior managers to get more ideas on what will help them.\n",
